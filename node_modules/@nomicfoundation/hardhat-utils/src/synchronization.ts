// Logic explanation: the fs.writeFile function, when used with the wx+ flag, performs an atomic operation to create a file.
// If multiple processes try to create the same file simultaneously, only one will succeed.
// This logic can be utilized to implement a mutex.
// ATTENTION: in the current implementation, there's still a risk of two processes running simultaneously.
// For example, if processA has locked the mutex and is running, processB will wait.
// During this wait, processB continuously checks the elapsed time since the mutex lock file was created.
// If an excessive amount of time has passed, processB will assume ownership of the mutex to prevent stale locks, even if processA is still running.
// As a result, two processes will be running simultaneously in what is theoretically a mutex-locked section.
